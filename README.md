Vehicle sales across different states and predicting future sales based on historical
data. Feature importance gives insight into which factors (e.g., State, Vehicle
Category) have the highest impact on sales.
Explanation:
● Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values.
● Feature Engineering: Created new columns from the Date column and
encoded categorical variables.
● Modeling: Built a Random Forest Regressor model to predict EV sales and
evaluated its performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
● Visualization: Visualized sales trends and feature importance using bar plots
and scatter plots.
